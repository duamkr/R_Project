## 어벤져스 : 엔드게임 워드클라우드

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
setwd("D:/workspace/R_Project/01_Crawling")
data <- readLines("a1.txt")
head(data)
useSejongDic()
data1 <- sapply(data, extractNoun, USE.NAMES=F)
head(unlist(data1), 30)
data1 <- gsub('\\d+','',data1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
